# Introduction #

This is not The Plan—this is just a place to write ideas worth exploring or at least thinking about.

# Ideas #

  * By i.atent.dead on the discuss list (http://groups.google.com/group/growldiscuss/msg/dd8b3e2ca76f4974):
    * Indicate apps that seem to support Growl (have a Growl framework) but are not registered with Growl
    * Indicate apps that are no longer installed
    * Possibly warn the user when they attempt to configure an app that is not registered [or is not installed —prh](.md)
  * prh: I envision three to four columns:
    1. Applications
    1. Notifications for this application
    1. Actions for this notification
    1. (Possibly) Settings for the action
> The settings would go into either that fourth column, the lower half of the third column, or a sheet, depending on space.

> Actions, as previously discussed elsewhere, are a superset of displays. An action can be a display, or a script, or another action such as sending an email message.

> This UI is easily modeled, and that model would generalize easily to the rest of Growl. No more notification dictionaries!
